### 4. ðŸš€ Content-Based Recommendation Engine
**Going beyond basic analysis, I built a machine learning system that recommends similar movies/shows based on plot and genre similarity.** Using NLP techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity, the engine can suggest content similar to any title in the dataset.

**Example Recommendation:**
- **Input:** "Stranger Things"
- **Output:** Horror/Mystery shows with similar themes and descriptions
- **Technology:** Scikit-learn, TF-IDF Vectorization, Cosine Similarity
